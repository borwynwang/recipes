# Cookies

### Chocolate Chip
**Ingredients**

* unsalted butter (100g)
* brown sugar (90g)
* granulated sugar (30g)
* egg (1) 
* vanilla extract or other flavor (2g)
* cake flour (100g)
* all purpose flour (100g)
* baking powder (2g)
* baking soda (1g)
* salt (1g)
* dark chocolate (140g)

**Instructions**

1. Warm butter to room temperature.
2. Cream butter and sugar with whisk or hand mixer. Add the sugar in 2 or 3 parts. The hand mixer works better than the whisk. 
3. Add flavorings.
4. Sift the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. 
5. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Don't overmix! 
6. Add the chocolate and fold a few more times until the dough becomes thick. 
7. Refrigerate for 30 min. 
8. Shape dough into balls and press them down onto the baking sheet. 
9. Bake at 190$^\circ$C (374$^\circ$F) for 12 min.
10. Cool on a cooling rack.

### Brownie Cookies
**Ingredients** 

* unsalted butter (60g)
* dark chocolate (100g)
* egg (1)
* brown sugar (100g)
* plain flour (65g)
* cocoa powder (10g)
* baking powder (1/2t)
* salt (1/8t)

**Instructions** 

* Melt butter with chocolate over boiling water that's been taken off the stove. It's easier to melt if the butter is cut into small chunks and the chocolate is shaved. 
* Cream egg and brown sugar. Hand mixer instead of whisk gives a better result. 
* Combine melted chocolate and sugar/egg. 
* Sift dry ingredients into the wet. 
* Fold. 
* Spoon the batter on a baking sheet. An ice cream scooper works. Don't spoon too much batter or else the cookies will spill into each other. Makes 8-9 cookies.
* Bake in the oven for 12 min at 180$^\circ$C (356$^\circ$F).
